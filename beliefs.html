								<h2>Core Values</h2>

								<h3>Scripturally Sound</h3>
								<p>
									The Word of God is living active and true! We will hold fast to the absolute truth
									of God’s Word, teach from it and learn from it every time we gather.
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+4%3A12&version=ESV" target="_blank">Hebrews 4:12,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3%3A16-17&version=ESV" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:16-17,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22&version=ESV" target="_blank">James 1:22,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A35&version=ESV" target="_blank">Matthew 24:35</a>)
									</p>
								
								<h3>Praising Passionately</h3>
								<p>
									God is the only one deserving of Praise. In the Scriptures it says that God
									inhabits the praises of His people. Encountering Gods presence in this way is life
									changing and there is power in our praise!
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+150%3A6&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalm 150:6,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4%3A24&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 4:24,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+103%3A1&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalm 103:1,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+71%3A8&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalm 71:8,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11%3A36&version=ESV" target="_blank">Romans 11:36,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+63%3A3-4&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalm 63:3-4</a>).
								</p>

								<h3>Praying Fervently</h3>
								<p>
									Prayer is the foundation of Mazevo. Prayer helps us align our hearts with the
									Fathers heart and as we pray, the Father hears the cry of our hearts as well.
									Miracles happen when we pray.
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A14&version=ESV" target="_blank">1 John 5:14,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A22-25&version=ESV" target="_blank">Mark 11:22-25,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A6-8&version=ESV" target="_blank">Matthew 6:6-8,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A19-20&version=ESV" target="_blank">Matthew 18:19-20</a>).
								</p>

								<h3>Creating Community</h3>
								<p>
									Genuine life on life fellowship with the community is important to the growth of
									the Church. We desire to create spaces that allow for community to be
									cultivated and for relationships to grow. Sundays are a catalyst for community to
									happen throughout the week. DON’T LET IT JUST BE SUNDAY!
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A42-47&version=ESV" target="_blank">Acts 2:42-47,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A24-25&version=ESV" target="_blank">Hebrews 10:24-25,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A30&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ephesians 5:30,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4%3A32&version=ESV" target="_blank">Acts 4:32,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A23&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 17:23</a>).
								</p>

								<h3>Serving Faithfully</h3>
								<p>
									Jesus was the perfect example of a servant. We desire to put the needs of others
									above ours and this type of culture will take care of people. No matter what the
									responsibility or task looks like, nothing is too big or too small for us
									to. “The Son of Man didn’t come to be served but to serve.”
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A41-45&version=ESV" target="_blank">Mark 10:41-45,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A35&version=ESV" target="_blank">Matthew 25:35,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6%3A10&version=ESV" target="_blank">Galatians 6:10,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22&version=ESV" target="_blank">James 1:22</a>).
								</p>

								<h3>Giving Generously</h3>
								<p>
									Everything that we have comes from the Lord, so we actively choose to give back
									to him and to support the Local Church. We give so the kingdom of God can be
									expanded, and our faith can be stretched further to trust God’s provision in our
									lives.
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+9%3A6-8&version=ESV" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 9:6-8,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A19&version=ESV" target="_blank">Philippians 4:19,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+3%3A10&version=ESV" target="_blank">Malachi 3:10,</a>
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+8%3A18&version=ESV" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>).
								</p>
								

								<br />
								<br />

								<h2>Statement of Faith</h2>

								<h3>God</h3>
								<p>We believe that there is only one living and true God, who exists in three distinct persons—God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 
								  These three, the Trinity, are equal in essence and distinct in function
								  (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+6%3A4&version=ESV" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 6:4;</a>
								  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A19&version=ESV" target="_blank">Matthew 28:19</a>).
								</p>

								<h3>The Father</h3>
								<p>The first person of the Trinity orders and directs all things according to his purpose and pleasure. He has created humanity to 
									bring him glory and honor, through his grace. While he is transcendent, he is also actively involved in his creation—offering a 
									life-giving and eternal relationship with us through his Son Jesus Christ
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A9&version=ESV" target="_blank">Matthew 6:9</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A19-24&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 5:19-24</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A3-6&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ephesians 1:3-6</a>,
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A1-10&version=ESV" target="_blank">2:1-10</a>).
								</p>

								<h3>The Son</h3>
								<p>Jesus Christ is both the eternal Son of God and virgin-born Son of man. Fully God, fully man, He surrendered nothing of His deity 
									during His earthly life. His sinless, sacrificial offering on the cross satisfied the Father's justice, offering atonement for all 
									of humanity's sins, for all time. We believe in his bodily resurrection, His physical ascension, and His visible return back to earth
									to establish His earthly kingdom
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14-18%3B&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 1:14-18</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I+Corinthians+15&version=ESV" target="_blank">I Corinthians 15</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1%3A3&version=ESV" target="_blank">Hebrews 1:3</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A9&version=ESV" target="_blank">Colossians 2:9</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+20%3A11-15&version=ESV" target="_blank">Revelation 20:11-15</a>).
								</p>

								<h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
								<p>The third person of the Trinity executes the will of God in this world through humanity, by leading, guiding, filling, teaching and convicting.
									The Holy Spirit is not merely an impersonal force, but is a person, displaying the qualities of personhood (intellect, emotions and will). He
									equips believers upon conversion by giving them gifts to be used for the building up of the church, and by bearing fruit through their yielded lives
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A5-16&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 16:5-16</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I+Corinthians+12&version=ESV" target="_blank">I Corinthians 12</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A10&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:10</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A1-8&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 3:1-8</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A1&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ephesians 1:1</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A16-25&version=ESV" target="_blank">Galatians 5:16-25</a>).
								</p>

								<h3>Humanity</h3>
								<p>We were created in the image of God, destined to enjoy an intimate relationship with God, fulfilling his will here on earth. But because of Adam 
									and Eve's willful sin in the garden, sin entered into the world, and has infected all of humanity. Therefore, because of our inherent sinful nature 
									received from our father Adam, we are all separated from God, spiritually dead, and destined for physical death and an eternity removed from God 
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1-3&version=ESV" target="_blank">Genesis 1-3</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A18-32&version=ESV" target="_blank">Romans 1:18-32</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3&version=ESV" target="_blank">Romans 3</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5&version=ESV" target="_blank">Romans 5</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A1-3&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>).</p>

								<h3>Salvation</h3>
								<p>We believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins as the only sufficient sacrifice, offering the atonement of sins for all mankind through his death,
									burial and resurrection. While salvation is available to all, it is only experienced by those who respond to God's gracious gift by faith apart from
									works. For those who do respond we are regenerated and baptized by the Holy Spirit, becoming children of God, given a new nature and placed into the
									universal body of Christ, making us eternally secure in him. As a result of our new relationship with God through his son Jesus, we are now called to
									 a life of submission to the Holy Spirit, manifesting spiritual fruit, and walking in good works that God has prepared beforehand for us to do
									 (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 14:6</a>;
									 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+3%3A4-7&version=ESV" target="_blank">Titus 3:4-7</a>;
									 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4%3A12&version=ESV" target="_blank">Acts 4:12</a>;
									 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A12&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 1:12</a>;
									 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A21-26&version=ESV" target="_blank">Romans 3:21-26</a>;
									 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A7&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ephesians 1:7</a>,
									 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8-9&version=ESV" target="_blank">2:8-9</a>;
									 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A10-12&version=ESV" target="_blank">Hebrews 10:10-12</a>;
									 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I+John+5%3A11-13&version=ESV" target="_blank">I John 5:11-13</a>;
									 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A26&version=ESV" target="_blank">Galatians 3:26</a>;
									 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 3:16</a>).
								</p>

								<h3>The Scriptures</h3>
								<p>We believe that every word in the original writings is inspired by God and is without error. The Word of God reveals God's nature and will for all of humanity,
									and because of this it is to be the foundation of faith and practice. We affirm that while the Scriptures are accurate in all matters it was never given to be
									an end in and of itself, but rather a means to a relationship with God. Because of this the authority and teaching of Scriptures will have a preeminent place in
									our ministry
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=II+Timothy+3%3A16-17&version=ESV" target="_blank">II Timothy 3:16-17</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=II+Peter+1%3A20-21&version=ESV" target="_blank">II Peter 1:20-21</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4%3A12&version=ESV" target="_blank">Hebrews 4:12</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A17&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 17:17</a>)
								</p>

								<h3>The Church</h3>
								<p>For all who have placed their faith in God through his son Jesus Christ, they are a part of the universal body of believers known as the church. This
									placement of the believer into the universal church requires an association of the believer with other followers of Christ in a local assembly.
									The purpose of the local church is to lead people to Christ and to bring them to maturity in Christ. The members of the local church are to live their 
									lives in humble submission to other Spirit-led believers, and to the God-appointed leaders of the church
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A24-25&version=ESV" target="_blank">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A41-47&version=ESV" target="_blank">Acts 2:41-47</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I+Corinthians+12-14&version=ESV" target="_blank">I Corinthians 12-14</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=ESV" target="_blank">Matthew 28:18-20</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A19-22&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I+Thessalonians+4%3A15-17&version=ESV" target="_blank">I Thessalonians 4:15-17</a>).
								</p>

								<h3>The Future</h3>
								<p>We believe that the next great event in human history will be the return of Jesus Christ for his children. This is the blessed hope for all followers of
									Jesus Christ. While this event is a prophetic truth of Scripture, we acknowledge that the point of Christ's return is not for the believer to passively
									await this event, but to labor with all of our might in the power of the Spirit to fulfill his will in our lives through righteous living, evangelism and 
									discipleship. After the return of Christ, those who accepted God's gracious gift of salvation will worship God forever in heaven. Those who did not will 
									spend an eternity separated from him in hell.
									(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A36&version=ESV" target="_blank">Matthew 24:36</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I+Thessalonians+4%3A15-17&version=ESV" target="_blank">I Thessalonians 4:15-17</a>;
									<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A1-3&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 14:1-3</a>;
